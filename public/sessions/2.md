Away from the confusion and disarray with the Cragmaw goblins, the wagon is back on the Triboar trial to Phandalin. Bounty of Nonsense, with his fine coat torn and soiled with blood, sits in the wagon along with Silder Hallwinter, badly beaten and with only threadbare clothing to his name. Friendly drives the wagon while Chappy shares the seat up front, and Nyoma and Pandjed parallel the cart on their horses. Sildar coughs a bit of blood into his fist and then, looking up, asks: "What in the world happened back there?" What ensues is a disjointed conversation of non-sequiters, partial explanations, and introductions. Silder and Bount greet each other, having known each other a bit back in Neverwinter, but unusually for the tabaxi, he is unable to carry much of a conversation as he is seriously shaken from the violence he just experienced.  

Sildar explains he and Gundren set out from Neverwinter some days ago and made fine time, but were set upon by the goblins and ambushed. He does not know where Gundren was taken. Everyone else but Bount chips in to tell the story from their perspective, including the knowledge that Gundren seems to have been taken to Cragmaw Castle. Almost everyone expresses incredulity about the sophistication of the goblins, and Sildar is equally baffled, though Chappy remarks on tales she has heard about a sophisticated nation of goblinfolk far to the south.  

Around dusk, the wagon pulls into the frontier town of Phandalin. It's a small town of log cabins and rough stone buildings, but even for its small size the town seems quite and still with a visceral sense of anticipation. Sildar refers the two groups to the Stonehill Inn near where they enter town from the north, and they stop the wagon there. Sildar heads on in, desperately needing rest and recovery. Friendly says she is going to visit her friend, the farmer Qelline Alderleaf, and see if she can lodge with Qelline and her wife. The rest enter the inn and make the acquaintance of Trilena and Toblen, the Innkeepers. Sildar and Bount take the two first-floor private rooms, and the rest of the group pays for beds in the shared upper-story loft. After a bit of grousing and retorts back and forth with Trilena, Chappy is exiled to a bed on a catwalk near the ceiling of the loft. But feelings are shortly smoothed over, and Chappy, Bounty, Nyoma, and Pandjed walk up the short flight of stairs to the common room of the Inn.  

Friendly leads Buddy the cow across town to the Alderleaf farm, on the southeast edge of Phandalin. Friendly knocks, and Qelline shouts hesitantly from behind the door, "Who's there?" It seems quizzical, but after the firbolg introduces herself through the wood, Qelline throws the door open and embraces Friendly. They chat warmly, catching up. Friendly asks for a favor, that she might keep Buddy in the Alderleaf's barn. "Because of all this trouble my people are having with the mining company, you see. I just want to make sure he's safe," she says. The halfling farmer readily agrees, but tells Friendly that there is at least some good news: the mining company has pulled up stakes and left town, due to the recent rumors and upset in the area. The only company representative still in town is young Halia Thornton, who used to be a low level clerk and now likes to style herself as the woman in charge. But, Qelline sadly notes, the real people in charge in the town right now are a group of young thugs known as the Redbrands. That gang is why Alderleaf was afraid to open the door, and they've been menacing the town for a while now. Friendly thanks her for the warning. Also, because Friendly mentioned her search for druidic allies as they caught up, Qelline asks Friendly for a favor in return. "I've got a friend with those sorts of talents, he ventured up to the Thundertree ruins to check things out and I haven't seen him in a while. Could you check on him? He might be a good person for you to know anyway, his name is Reidoth." Friendly agrees and wishes Qelline a good night, before heading off back to the center of town.  

Back at the Inn, the four wanderers have been chatting happily with Toblen Stonehill. Toblen is especially pleased to see Bounty of Nonsense again, wrapping him in a warm hug and referring to him as "m'lord." They order drinks, and after a bit of enjoyable back and forth, Bounty inquires of Toblen, "Say, friend. What is the story of that great boar head above the fireplace?" The Innkeeper launches into a tale, not about himself but of the noted Falcon the Hunter from the nearby Neverwinter Woods. Falcon is quite the game hunter, but while tracking a particular elk one morning, he discovered he was being followed by a strange looking boar. Then, a few days later, he noticed either that same boar or another like it again. And it became a pattern, him feeling watched whenever he entered the depths of the forest to pursue his quarries. So Falcon, thinking that boars are intelligent and could "get the message," set to hunt one. After days of cat and mouse he bagged his prey, and Falcon made a gift of the head to Toblen as a personal kindness. Appreciative of the story, Bount launches into one of his own in return. He tells an exaggerated version of their adventure with the weapon, and by the time he is done all of the smattering of villagers in the common room have their eyes on the tabaxi and his exotic looking comrades. When he reaches his climax there is scattered applause, and a few copper pieces wind their way to the group's table. 

After ordering food, the four converse amongst themselves about the recent events and their plans for the future. When Toblen brings their meals, the characters again engage him in conversation. Chappy asks the Innkeeper more about Falcon, and about the woods he inhabits, noting a certain apprehension in Toblen's tone as he told his tale earlier. Mr. Stonehill does admit some trepidation about the woods, especially as folk have been disappearing there of late. The Wood was never the friendliest place, but people speak of deeper shadows and more threatening wildlife all the time. In fact, a group of woodworkers and loggers from Phandalin, including the brother of Elmar Barthen of the general store, headed deep into the woods to create a logger's camp. The very few communications returned from them speak of rising tension between the loggers, with some believing the camp to be "cursed" or the loggers to be otherwise doomed. In response to this news, the halfling pulls out her reporter's notebook and begins quizzing Toblin on the details. "Well you know, it's important to get everything down for the Neverwinter Chronicle! … though don't necessarily expect to, uh, read about that any time soon. Mail from this far out is very unreliable, as you may have observed!" Chappy also inquires about her Uncle Al Kalazorn, who the Innkeeper is familiar with. He has not seen Al in a bit, but also thinks that Elmar of Barthen's Provisions would be likely to know more.  

While Chappy speaks to Toblen, Bount and Nyoma suddenly hear something odd: a birdlike caw outside that also simultaneously sounds like Bount saying his own name? Moving to investigate, they open the door to the inn and discover a crow outside – a crow cawing something remarkably similar to "Bount!" or "Friendly!" The bird is vexing, variably perching on Bount's shoulder or flying up into the rafter of the common room. Once again the group is attracting the wide-eyed attention of other patrons. Eventually an insight occurs to Nyoma and she whispers to the tabaxi, "Do you think this... could BE Friendly?" Shock is the general response, and Bounty heads with the bird outside. And indeed, the bird magically transforms back into Friendly! The tabaxi is slightly stunned, and Friendly informs him she only just learned how to do this particular trick: "It's almost as if I've reached some arbitrary plateau of power!" Bounty is distracted for a short while wondering if that's something HE could learn to do. Nyoma seems quite entertained by the entire business, as Bount tries to convince Friendly of the need for subtlety moving forward. After a while more conversation, the group retires for the night. The four head to their beds at the inn, while Friendly heads to the Alderleaf barn to sleep with Buddy.  

During the night, Chappy is woken by strange sounds outside the window. Peering out, up in the sky she spots an impossibly large reptilian beast, extremely pale in color and luminous in the moonlight, flapping its creaking wings as it flies in circle over the town. Absolutely stunned, the halfling falls right out of the bed. This side wakes Nyoma, and she calls up, "Chappy? Are you okay?" Chappy whispers back, "D-d-d-d-d-dragon!" Nyoma makes a delighted and fascinated noise and runs to the window, but whatever was there now seems to be gone. Still, she believes the halfing, and tells her how much she would have liked to see a dragon. Chappy does not agree, being generally shaken by the sight. The two eventually return to bed.  

The next morning, the individual characters split up on various errands of their own. Pandjed remains at the inn to manage his affairs. Bount heads to have his coat repaired, while Friendly spends the morning picking weeds before planning to meet up with the tabaxi. Chappy and Nyoma individually take in the town, but both end up converging on the town square around mid-morning. The halfling spots a small stone shrine to Tymora, the Goddess of Luck, currently being tended to by a dwarven woman on her hands and knees. Chappy walks up to ask her about her dwarven Uncle Al, surprising the woman in the process and causing her to quite clumsily bash her head on a shelf of the shrine. Getting up and dusting herself off, the woman introduces herself casually as Sister Graele, the keeper of the Shrine of Luck here in Phandalin. Chappy is a bit surprised at the lack of formality Graele displays. She asks the Sister about Al Kalazorn, and if she's heard anything. Graele, who seems quite absent-minded, thinks to herself and says, "You know, to think of it, I haven't seen him in quite a while. Have you ever seen a hyena? Haven't seen one myself, but Big Al says they look like what a cat would look like if it were pretending to be a dog. They roam the plains far to the east, but not around here. Anyway, Al said he saw them around his property – them, and some larger creatures in the night he could never quite identify. I do hope he's alright."  

Chappy frowns, and thanks Graele, and prepares to leave. But before she can, the Sister interjects, "Oy there. You seem like a capable sort." She pauses. "How do you feel about ghosts?" It's an odd and disjointed turn, and Chappy says, "Fair enough, I suppose?" Graele explains that in her personal researches, she's learned of a "ghost, or a spirit, or a banshee?" who might have some information related to the location of a very old wizard named Bowgentle, which Graele would greatly like to find. "I've got this comb and I think buttering old Agatha up would get the information out of her, but sad to say I made her quite angry last I visited." Graele asks Chappy if she would mind delivering the comb and trying to get the information out of the spirit? There is a path north from old abandoned Conyberry, a short ways into the forest and she's right there. Chappy, confused but always interested in a potential story, tentatively agrees to help and takes the comb.  

Bount and Friendly meet up on the southeast end of town. As they talk, suddenly Friendly spots some young toughs wearing red cloaks sauntering down the dirt road – presumably the Redbrands. They decide to sneak after them. But as the redcloaks enter the town square, they happen to turn and spot the two outsiders before they can move out of the way. The young street toughs approach Bount and Friendly, and begin trying to accost them for money. Bounty attempts to bluff his way out with his signet ring, but the thuggish redcloaks are too ignorant to even know what it is supposed to be. The redbrands wave over a larger, meaner looking friend of theirs as he enters the square, and tensions rise. Nyoma spots the growing confrontation, and with a discrete wave of her fingers creates a hand of magical energy she carefully places right behind the half cloak of the meaner looking thug. He moves toward Friendly and Bounty threateningly seeking to physically take the demanded "tax," and as he does so Nyoma's spectral hand intertwines itself with the folds of the cloak, and yanks the brute back. He stumbles back, trying to free himself from the cloak as it pulls and plays with him, and the other youths yell at him to stop playing about, referring to him as Jaren. At this confusion, Friendly steps forward and summons her mystical powers, creating a crackling green aura around the redbrands. Seeing this obvious display of magic, the gang begins shouting and cursing the characters as they fall back out of the square and begin running along the road out of town to the east. The group gives chase!  

While they might have expected the thugs to escape to the Sleeping Giant taproom, which they had heard was a favorite location of the Redbrands, the gang continues running out of town and up some low hills to the burned out Tresendar Manor on the very eastern edge of Phandalin. Friendly transforms once more into a bird, but this time a hawk, and scouts out the manor. Completely destroyed and only exhibiting ruined walls and still-solid foundations, Friendly the hawk spots a set of stairs leading down into the earth, presumably into a cellar. The redcloaks are nowhere to be seen. The rest of the group proceeds to the Manor. Nyoma summons her deeper perceptions, and feels the tingle of a magical source somewhere below ground. "That would be something worth protecting," she comments to the others.  

As a group, they investigate the stairs. Slowly descending, they find themselves in a torchlit cellar storehouse, with a large deep cistern on one end of the room. There is a door near the entrance and also one near the cistern, and they are able to spot moving shadows in the room through the door next to the cistern. Nyoma once again reaches out to feel the call of power, and is able to feel that something of vague magical energy lies beyond the wall to the left of the cistern, strangely enough. The group carefully treads to the other end of the room, and begins setting about creating a display of force, so to speak. Chappy summons up illusionary magics to create an image of two flaming fist guards standing tall on either side of Bount, who positions himself in front of the door. On a count of three, Nyoma reaches out with the tendrils of her power and slams the door to the room with a resounding crack! Bounty commands, "IN THE NAME OF THE FLAMING FIST PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPONS!" And at the same time, Friendly collects nature's power within herself and unleashes it as a thunderous wave of pressure right into the small room. The four redcloaks are indeed there, and one is knocked off his feet into the wall behind them. The remaining thugs seem terrified at the power being unleashed on them, but Jaran screams "Fight them, boys! It's this or death!" And the gang members lunge forward at the characters. A short bloody fight ensues, in which Nyoma tries again to command the youths to lay down their weapons, but they are too caught up in the rush of battle. By the end, Jaran is unconscious and Bount is once again bleeding through his coat, but the Redbrands have been put down with no actual deaths.  

The party wakes one of the other three non-Jaran redcloaks, and interrogates him. Friendly intimidates him with a murderous-seeming fakeout involving death threats and a coin, but eventually the Redbrand member fesses up that this room is but the entrance to a larger secret complex underneath the manor which the Redbrands use as a hideout. He informs the characters the Redbrands are just local boys hired by a wizard named Glasstaff. The youth counts their number at around a dozen, not including the hobgoblins. "Hobgoblins?" Inquires almost everyone in the party simultaneously, to which the redcloak responds, "Oh, yeah. The spider sent them to make sure we was doing what he wants, since I guess Glasstaff works for him." The characters share a look of surprise and intrigue at this, though Chappy seems inordinately happy about "conspiracies" and "dark secrets." "Think of the story this could be!" she tells the group. The characters inquire about what this particular gang member has been up to, and he insists he has been mostly harmless, just exorting businesses for protection money. He does let slip that Jaren did kill that one wood worker, and they did end up kidnapping the woodworker's wife and daughter to be held here in the complex, but he insists that was Jaren and that everyone knows Jaren has a temper. After some haranging about morality and good decisions and making better choices by Nyoma, the group opts to let the three follower gang members leave after forcing them to promise to atone for their crimes by working for Sister Graele at the shrine. And also by leaving their coinage and valuables here to be collected by the party. The four unanimously agree to however leave Jaren tied up in the side room where the melee occurred. The follower ex-Redbrands beat it out of the cellar, but not before providing two more helpful bits of information: one, to watch out for the "eye monster," and two, that the prisoners are near the old crypt, which is full of "horrible old walking skeletons, like something out of a nightmare."  

Exploring the wall to the left of the cistern, the party is able to discover a secret door leading to a long hallway passing off into unknown regions. Friendly transforms into a rat, and begins stalking forward down the twisting hall. The hall eventually opens up into a long, tall natural cavern with a chasm running longwise through it. As Friendly the rat studies the scene before her, an intrusive thought in her head suddenly adopts words as a rasping sentence is forced into her consciousness: "Well, hello there interesting little creature. You are much too big for the tiny body you currently inhabit."
