It's midmorning, and a trio of travelers are sitting around a cooking fire, with a loaded ox-driven wagon a short distance away. Chappy Quickstep, a halfling in conspicuously new travel leathers, is taking freshly cooked food off the fire. Bounty of Nonsense, a tabaxi in fancy clothing, is reclining prone on his back. And Friendly, a firbolg in simple homespun, is sitting down, munching oats and occasionally offering some to her cow companion. Bount and Friendly chat happily, while Chappy grouses both about wanting to get this job over with and having to endure the gentle teasing of the other two. Eventually the three decide to pack up and move on, Friendly conscientiously ensuring she and her \"new friends\" leave no trace. They are traveling south down the High Road from Neverwinter to parts south, en route to the frontier town of Phandalin on a job to deliver some supplies for a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker and a human named Silder Hallwinter. They are about half a day out from their destination.</p>\n        <p>Heading north on that same high road are two horses, slowly ambling their way along the road. Riding the horses are the tiefling Nyoma Izarren, dressed in teal and gray, and the dragonborn Prexijandilin Pandjet, sporting shining heavy armor and a visibly-displayed shield. Nyoma enthusiastically tries to draw Pandjet into conversation, though as in the previous days of their journey he continues to be relatively taciturn. They have been traveling for weeks, journeying up from the region of Candlekeep and Baldur's Gate on errands toward Phandelin. They have already had their fair share of trouble and unusual events on the road. About midday, they turn eastward onto the Triboar trail which will take them to their rough and tumble destination. The road becomes twisty, and begins to climb into hills that will eventually rise to form the Sword Mountains. Shortly after taking the turn, Pandjet and Nyoma notice a wagon just a short way behind them, moving in the same direction at roughly the same speed. The duo on horseback and the trio on the wagon share genial waves at a distance from each other. Their journey proceeds like this for an hour or so, before they turn a corner and are confronted with the unmistakable sight of two dead horses a hundred yards up the trail.</p>\n        <p>The duo halt their horses and study the scene. A ways up the road, the trail narrows with two sharp escarpments topped with trees leaning in on both sides. The two dead horses are laid out on the tightest part of the path, decorated with numerous arrows apiece. Squinting ahead, Pandjet is able to pick out several figures only slightly hidden among the trees of the ridges. Nyoma suggests they wait for the wagon behind, to potentially have a bit more support for what lies ahead. Pandjet is concerned as to what those behind could want, but they agree to wait. The trio in the wagon approaches, and friendly greetings are shared on both sides. Friendly and friends seem more than willing to help navigate the (only slightly) hidden lurkers ahead, and the five together travel forward, with the wagon taking the lead. Bount climbs the escarpment on the left side and begins shadowing the main group as they proceed, taking cover in the underbrush.</p>\n        <p>Approaching the narrow point of the path, the three in the wagon and the two on horseback are met by a collection of goblins in simple brown and white uniforms, each with what looks like a shoulder patch insignia of a pair of jaws with sharp, jagged teeth. One goblin in particular, a woman with an abrasive personality and eyes that dart from place to place (who the party will later learn is named Clash), approaches the group and serves as the representative for the others hiding among the trees. She demands the group's traveling papers. An argument ensues in which various characters express incredulity about any need for papers and question exactly where these goblins came from. Clash informs them they are soldiers in the Cragmaw Auxiliary, a military force invited to the area by \"responsible authorities\" to assert law and order on this \"backwards and chaotic\" region. Nyoma tries to talk reason with the goblins, Friendly confusedly mocks them for their demands, and Chappy seems baffled about the goblin's literateness. The argument increases swiftly in tension, without any progress being made.</p>\n        <p>While the rest of the group argues with the Cragmaw soldiers, Bount ascends a tree near the narrow point, where a goblin has taken up a post among the branches with a shortbow trained on the individuals below. Moving swiftly as a breeze, the tabaxi is able to place himself directly behind the solder in the tree, and he claps his hand over the goblin's mouth while threatening aggressively with the guard of his sword. Bounty hisses, \"I will end you unless you stop your friends down there – right now. Drop your weapon.\" The soldier dutifully nods agreement, and drops his weapon. Unfortunately, as they are in a tree, this produces an awful racket as the bow and arrows clatter noisily from branch to branch on their way to the ground. Clash orders the remaining goblins to attack! A noisy confusing melee results. By the time the dust clears, Bount has knocked the goblin in the tree out and to the ground with the guard of his sword, Chappy has strummed sorcerous chords on her lute to lull two of the soldiers into unconsciousness, and a combination of vines summoned by Friendly and a threatened burst of sidereal energy held in the hand of Nyoma force Clash to surrender on behalf of her troops, given she is the only one remaining conscious.</p>\n        <p>With some hesitation, Clash agrees to tell the party anything they want to know. She informs them she is the sergeant of this group of goblins, and they were provided orders to specifically detain Gundren Rockseeker and Sildar Hallwinter and hand them over to someone known as the \"Black Spider.\" Her last understanding was that they had been taken to the local unit encampment, located in a cave five miles northwest, shortly to be moved to their company headquarters at Cragmaw Castle north of Phandelin inside Neverwinter Wood. After some additional questioning, she also reveals the presence of traps along the route. Bount rifles through her pockets discretely, and comes up with a crude handwritten map which he secrets away from the other characters. Friendly forces her to write them authorized travel papers to hopefully avoid this situation again. The five then debate whether or not to travel to the cave HQ or to Phandelin. Pandjet initially seems hesitant, but is convinced by Nyoma and the others to attempt to rescue the hostages. The group sets out northwest.</p>\n        <p>Despite his initial hesitation about the detour, Pandjet confidently takes point and leads the group through the briar patches and copses of trees on the way to their destination. While they travel this way, Bount shows Friendly the map he found, and specifically the worrying room on the map marked \"The Weapon.\" Friendly is less subtle about the secret map than the tabaxi would otherwise like. Unfortunately for Pandjet, for his assertiveness he is paid back by being caught in a snare trap two miles into the hike, though thankfully he ends up unharmed. After this and a comment by Bounty of Nonsense that he has some experience with traps, the others side-eye Bount into taking point. A short while later, he trips the second and final expected hazard, a pit trap, but his agility allows him to sidestep actually being caught in it.</p>\n        <p>Shortly after, the five reach a sharply ascending hill with a large opening, with two large banners bearing the Cragmaw emblem on them. Out of the opening flows a narrow shallow stream. Here the group encounters two goblin soldiers standing guard - they yell \"Who goes there!\" in the midst of the group's debating on a plan of action. Thinking on her feet, Friendly responds they have arrived to take the prisoners to the Black Spider. The guards seem confused, as one of the prisoners has already been transferred! But the group is able to soothe things over and win the trust of the guards. One of the guards escorts them to meet with Yenniw, the corporal and superior officer of this Auxiliary Unit. As they snake their way inside, bordering the stream and climbing a number of stairs as the cave ascends inside the hill, Bounty of Nonsense trails behind. He spots a small set of stairs leading up into the room marked on the map as holding the Weapon, and his curiosity gets the better of him. He blusters and bluffs about needing to check that the entire Unit operations are in ship-shape, and the rest of the group moves on without him, heading around and over a bridge spanning the stream into the large relatively comfortable quarters of the goblins.</p>\n        <p>The remaining four encounter Yenniw in the large, warm, and well-lit living space of the goblins. He is seated at his desk on an upper level of the room, furiously scribbling away at papers. Yenniw has a slick, mean grin on his face and is generally corpulent. They also spot a prone unmoving human-sized figure half-hidden behind a stalagmite, also on the upper level. Friendly takes the lead and reasserts to Yenniw that the group is here to take the prisoner to the Black Spider. The corporal seems quite surprised at this, and replies that he was not aware of any prisoner transfer taking place. Friendly bluffs that there must be something seriously amiss if the Spider is issuing orders through Clash now rather than Yenniw, and that it would be in the corporal's best interest not to anger their shared superior further. Yenniw studies them for a while, but it is not long before his standard sly grin returns to his face. He returns to the group, gripping the edges of his desk with his fingers (moving his finger to press a button on the underside unnoticed by anyone), and informs the group that he will help them out by letting them take the prisoner, if they help him out by doing a routine check on \"the Weapon's containment system.\" Chappy puts on a show of acting baffled, asking Yenniw, \"Do you think this is FUN for us? Just let us do our damn job!\" After some more back and forth, he agrees to let them take the prisoner – Sildar Hallwinter, as it turns out – with them on their way to check the containment system. Everyone agrees to this plan.</p>\n        <p>Meanwhile, Bount spends some time making the acquaintance of the guard stationed at the door to the room where the Weapon is supposed to be located. She gives him some ominous sounding instructions, including maintaining a five foot distance, which he readily agrees to before cautiously stepping inside. The room is quite large, and dark to boot. Creeping forward into the dim chamber, Bounty of Nonsense approaches quite close to what turns out to be a large metal cage. Inside the cage is a forlorn-looking wolf pressed against the floor, growling low. But more importantly, also lurking inside is an eight foot tall powerfully-built hairy creature. It is standing upright and leaning forward menacingly, breathing raggedly and with intense glowing red eyes fixed directly on the tabaxi. Bount's mouth falls open, trying to make sense of the scene. But as he takes it all in, a loud metallic click sounds through the room, and a series of gears begin turning. The last of these gears whirrs as it unlocks and swings open the main front door of the cage. The thing inside exhales a low rumbled moan, while the wolf's growl increases in intensity. With a surprisingly smoothness and quietness, the creature that is apparently the weapon lifts a javelin lying nearby the cage and hurls it at Bount before lumbering out of the cage toward him. The tabaxi uses every ounce of his feline reflexes to flee headlong out the room, yelling to the previously chatty goblin guard to run for her life, the weapon has escaped!</p>\n        <p>The rest of the group is emerging from the goblin quarters to the bridge over the stream. Sildar was initially confused and hostile toward the seeming allies of the goblins, but Chappy and Nyoma healed and helped the man, and did their best to communicate silently to him that this was a rescue attempt. Yet as the four of them emerge onto the bridge, they encounter Bounty running as fast as he can the other way. \"The weapon is a living weapon and it's escaped and we need to leave NOW!\" Bount yells, with both the wolf and the creature hot on his heels behind. What comes next is absolute madness, with goblins from the chambers next to the weapon's screaming and fleeing in all directions, and the party trying to get everyone down from the bridge while holding off the wolf and the weapon, both intent on mauling anyone in their path. The weapon skewers Bount with a javelin and he falls unconscious, but is brought back to consciousness by Nyoma. Pandjet moves to protect the others, blocking off the far side of the bridge after Bount flees and Friendly jumps down to the lower level. Pandjet's steadfastness proves true, allowing him to hold the line despite suffering the sharp gnashing jaws of the wolf.</p>\n        <p>While Pandjet holds off the slavering canine, Chappy and Nyoma take up position on the bridge behind him. Finally, bleeding and bitten, the dragonborn leaps athletically down from the bridge, clearing the way for the two practitioners of the mystic arts. Nyoma launches bursts of destructive starstuff at the wolf and the weapon, while Chappy unleashes insults and barbs with words that carry the base vibrations of the fabric of reality, unmaking their foes from the inside out. The wolf is finally undone, and the great hairy beast pauses from the onslaught. Seizing the opportunity and newly conscious, Bounty catches the perfect angle and lets loose an arrow from below! The arrow flies fast and lodges itself between the beast's eyes, and with blood streaming down its face, it collapses into a wet muddy heap.</p>\n        <p>Friendly with her eight foot stature is able to help everyone still above down from the bridge. The group, now six with rescued hostage Sildar Hallweather in tow, is able to flee at pace out of the cave. They collect their wagon and horses, and safely hightail it away from the scene with the Cragmaw goblins still in total disarray from the violent chaotic scene just moments before.</p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  } else if (props.session === 2) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p>Away from the confusion and disarray with the Cragmaw goblins, the wagon is back on the Triboar trial to Phandalin. Bounty of Nonsense, with his fine coat torn and soiled with blood, sits in the wagon along with Silder Hallwinter, badly beaten and with only threadbare clothing to his name. Friendly drives the wagon while Chappy shares the seat up front, and Nyoma and Pandjed parallel the cart on their horses. Sildar coughs a bit of blood into his fist and then, looking up, asks: \"What in the world happened back there?\" What ensues is a disjointed conversation of non-sequiters, partial explanations, and introductions. Silder and Bount greet each other, having known each other a bit back in Neverwinter, but unusually for the tabaxi, he is unable to carry much of a conversation as he is seriously shaken from the violence he just experienced.</p>\n        <p>Sildar explains he and Gundren set out from Neverwinter some days ago and made fine time, but were set upon by the goblins and ambushed. He does not know where Gundren was taken. Everyone else but Bount chips in to tell the story from their perspective, including the knowledge that Gundren seems to have been taken to Cragmaw Castle. Almost everyone expresses incredulity about the sophistication of the goblins, and Sildar is equally baffled, though Chappy remarks on tales she has heard about a sophisticated nation of goblinfolk far to the south.</p>\n        <p>Around dusk, the wagon pulls into the frontier town of Phandalin. It's a small town of log cabins and rough stone buildings, but even for its small size the town seems quite and still with a visceral sense of anticipation. Sildar refers the two groups to the Stonehill Inn near where they enter town from the north, and they stop the wagon there. Sildar heads on in, desperately needing rest and recovery. Friendly says she is going to visit her friend, the farmer Qelline Alderleaf, and see if she can lodge with Qelline and her wife. The rest enter the inn and make the acquaintance of Trilena and Toblen, the Innkeepers. Sildar and Bount take the two first-floor private rooms, and the rest of the group pays for beds in the shared upper-story loft. After a bit of grousing and retorts back and forth with Trilena, Chappy is exiled to a bed on a catwalk near the ceiling of the loft. But feelings are shortly smoothed over, and Chappy, Bounty, Nyoma, and Pandjed walk up the short flight of stairs to the common room of the Inn.</p>\n        <p>Friendly leads Buddy the cow across town to the Alderleaf farm, on the southeast edge of Phandalin. Friendly knocks, and Qelline shouts hesitantly from behind the door, \"Who's there?\" It seems quizzical, but after the firbolg introduces herself through the wood, Qelline throws the door open and embraces Friendly. They chat warmly, catching up. Friendly asks for a favor, that she might keep Buddy in the Alderleaf's barn. \"Because of all this trouble my people are having with the mining company, you see. I just want to make sure he's safe,\" she says. The halfling farmer readily agrees, but tells Friendly that there is at least some good news: the mining company has pulled up stakes and left town, due to the recent rumors and upset in the area. The only company representative still in town is young Halia Thornton, who used to be a low level clerk and now likes to style herself as the woman in charge. But, Qelline sadly notes, the real people in charge in the town right now are a group of young thugs known as the Redbrands. That gang is why Alderleaf was afraid to open the door, and they've been menacing the town for a while now. Friendly thanks her for the warning. Also, because Friendly mentioned her search for druidic allies as they caught up, Qelline asks Friendly for a favor in return. \"I've got a friend with those sorts of talents, he ventured up to the Thundertree ruins to check things out and I haven't seen him in a while. Could you check on him? He might be a good person for you to know anyway, his name is Reidoth.\" Friendly agrees and wishes Qelline a good night, before heading off back to the center of town.</p>\n        <p>Back at the Inn, the four wanderers have been chatting happily with Toblen Stonehill. Toblen is especially pleased to see Bounty of Nonsense again, wrapping him in a warm hug and referring to him as \"m'lord.\" They order drinks, and after a bit of enjoyable back and forth, Bounty inquires of Toblen, \"Say, friend. What is the story of that great boar head above the fireplace?\" The Innkeeper launches into a tale, not about himself but of the noted Falcon the Hunter from the nearby Neverwinter Woods. Falcon is quite the game hunter, but while tracking a particular elk one morning, he discovered he was being followed by a strange looking boar. Then, a few days later, he noticed either that same boar or another like it again. And it became a pattern, him feeling watched whenever he entered the depths of the forest to pursue his quarries. So Falcon, thinking that boars are intelligent and could \"get the message,\" set to hunt one. After days of cat and mouse he bagged his prey, and Falcon made a gift of the head to Toblen as a personal kindness. Appreciative of the story, Bount launches into one of his own in return. He tells an exaggerated version of their adventure with the weapon, and by the time he is done all of the smattering of villagers in the common room have their eyes on the tabaxi and his exotic looking comrades. When he reaches his climax there is scattered applause, and a few copper pieces wind their way to the group's table.</p>\n        <p>After ordering food, the four converse amongst themselves about the recent events and their plans for the future. When Toblen brings their meals, the characters again engage him in conversation. Chappy asks the Innkeeper more about Falcon, and about the woods he inhabits, noting a certain apprehension in Toblen's tone as he told his tale earlier. Mr. Stonehill does admit some trepidation about the woods, especially as folk have been disappearing there of late. The Wood was never the friendliest place, but people speak of deeper shadows and more threatening wildlife all the time. In fact, a group of woodworkers and loggers from Phandalin, including the brother of Elmar Barthen of the general store, headed deep into the woods to create a logger's camp. The very few communications returned from them speak of rising tension between the loggers, with some believing the camp to be \"cursed\" or the loggers to be otherwise doomed. In response to this news, the halfling pulls out her reporter's notebook and begins quizzing Toblin on the details. \"Well you know, it's important to get everything down for the Neverwinter Chronicle! … though don't necessarily expect to, uh, read about that any time soon. Mail from this far out is very unreliable, as you may have observed!\" Chappy also inquires about her Uncle Al Kalazorn, who the Innkeeper is familiar with. He has not seen Al in a bit, but also thinks that Elmar of Barthen's Provisions would be likely to know more.</p>\n        <p>While Chappy speaks to Toblen, Bount and Nyoma suddenly hear something odd: a birdlike caw outside that also simultaneously sounds like Bount saying his own name? Moving to investigate, they open the door to the inn and discover a crow outside – a crow cawing something remarkably similar to \"Bount!\" or \"Friendly!\" The bird is vexing, variably perching on Bount's shoulder or flying up into the rafter of the common room. Once again the group is attracting the wide-eyed attention of other patrons. Eventually an insight occurs to Nyoma and she whispers to the tabaxi, \"Do you think this... could BE Friendly?\" Shock is the general response, and Bounty heads with the bird outside. And indeed, the bird magically transforms back into Friendly! The tabaxi is slightly stunned, and Friendly informs him she only just learned how to do this particular trick: \"It's almost as if I've reached some arbitrary plateau of power!\" Bounty is distracted for a short while wondering if that's something HE could learn to do. Nyoma seems quite entertained by the entire business, as Bount tries to convince Friendly of the need for subtlety moving forward. After a while more conversation, the group retires for the night. The four head to their beds at the inn, while Friendly heads to the Alderleaf barn to sleep with Buddy.</p>\n        <p>During the night, Chappy is woken by strange sounds outside the window. Peering out, up in the sky she spots an impossibly large reptilian beast, extremely pale in color and luminous in the moonlight, flapping its creaking wings as it flies in circle over the town. Absolutely stunned, the halfling falls right out of the bed. This side wakes Nyoma, and she calls up, \"Chappy? Are you okay?\" Chappy whispers back, \"D-d-d-d-d-dragon!\" Nyoma makes a delighted and fascinated noise and runs to the window, but whatever was there now seems to be gone. Still, she believes the halfing, and tells her how much she would have liked to see a dragon. Chappy does not agree, being generally shaken by the sight. The two eventually return to bed.</p>\n        <p>The next morning, the individual characters split up on various errands of their own. Pandjed remains at the inn to manage his affairs. Bount heads to have his coat repaired, while Friendly spends the morning picking weeds before planning to meet up with the tabaxi. Chappy and Nyoma individually take in the town, but both end up converging on the town square around mid-morning. The halfling spots a small stone shrine to Tymora, the Goddess of Luck, currently being tended to by a dwarven woman on her hands and knees. Chappy walks up to ask her about her dwarven Uncle Al, surprising the woman in the process and causing her to quite clumsily bash her head on a shelf of the shrine. Getting up and dusting herself off, the woman introduces herself casually as Sister Graele, the keeper of the Shrine of Luck here in Phandalin. Chappy is a bit surprised at the lack of formality Graele displays. She asks the Sister about Al Kalazorn, and if she's heard anything. Graele, who seems quite absent-minded, thinks to herself and says, \"You know, to think of it, I haven't seen him in quite a while. Have you ever seen a hyena? Haven't seen one myself, but Big Al says they look like what a cat would look like if it were pretending to be a dog. They roam the plains far to the east, but not around here. Anyway, Al said he saw them around his property – them, and some larger creatures in the night he could never quite identify. I do hope he's alright.\"</p>\n        <p>Chappy frowns, and thanks Graele, and prepares to leave. But before she can, the Sister interjects, \"Oy there. You seem like a capable sort.\" She pauses. \"How do you feel about ghosts?\" It's an odd and disjointed turn, and Chappy says, \"Fair enough, I suppose?\" Graele explains that in her personal researches, she's learned of a \"ghost, or a spirit, or a banshee?\" who might have some information related to the location of a very old wizard named Bowgentle, which Graele would greatly like to find. \"I've got this comb and I think buttering old Agatha up would get the information out of her, but sad to say I made her quite angry last I visited.\" Graele asks Chappy if she would mind delivering the comb and trying to get the information out of the spirit? There is a path north from old abandoned Conyberry, a short ways into the forest and she's right there. Chappy, confused but always interested in a potential story, tentatively agrees to help and takes the comb.</p>\n        <p>Bount and Friendly meet up on the southeast end of town. As they talk, suddenly Friendly spots some young toughs wearing red cloaks sauntering down the dirt road – presumably the Redbrands. They decide to sneak after them. But as the redcloaks enter the town square, they happen to turn and spot the two outsiders before they can move out of the way. The young street toughs approach Bount and Friendly, and begin trying to accost them for money. Bounty attempts to bluff his way out with his signet ring, but the thuggish redcloaks are too ignorant to even know what it is supposed to be. The redbrands wave over a larger, meaner looking friend of theirs as he enters the square, and tensions rise. Nyoma spots the growing confrontation, and with a discrete wave of her fingers creates a hand of magical energy she carefully places right behind the half cloak of the meaner looking thug. He moves toward Friendly and Bounty threateningly seeking to physically take the demanded \"tax,\" and as he does so Nyoma's spectral hand intertwines itself with the folds of the cloak, and yanks the brute back. He stumbles back, trying to free himself from the cloak as it pulls and plays with him, and the other youths yell at him to stop playing about, referring to him as Jaren. At this confusion, Friendly steps forward and summons her mystical powers, creating a crackling green aura around the redbrands. Seeing this obvious display of magic, the gang begins shouting and cursing the characters as they fall back out of the square and begin running along the road out of town to the east. The group gives chase!</p>\n        <p>While they might have expected the thugs to escape to the Sleeping Giant taproom, which they had heard was a favorite location of the Redbrands, the gang continues running out of town and up some low hills to the burned out Tresendar Manor on the very eastern edge of Phandalin. Friendly transforms once more into a bird, but this time a hawk, and scouts out the manor. Completely destroyed and only exhibiting ruined walls and still-solid foundations, Friendly the hawk spots a set of stairs leading down into the earth, presumably into a cellar. The redcloaks are nowhere to be seen. The rest of the group proceeds to the Manor. Nyoma summons her deeper perceptions, and feels the tingle of a magical source somewhere below ground. \"That would be something worth protecting,\" she comments to the others.</p>\n        <p>As a group, they investigate the stairs. Slowly descending, they find themselves in a torchlit cellar storehouse, with a large deep cistern on one end of the room. There is a door near the entrance and also one near the cistern, and they are able to spot moving shadows in the room through the door next to the cistern. Nyoma once again reaches out to feel the call of power, and is able to feel that something of vague magical energy lies beyond the wall to the left of the cistern, strangely enough. The group carefully treads to the other end of the room, and begins setting about creating a display of force, so to speak. Chappy summons up illusionary magics to create an image of two flaming fist guards standing tall on either side of Bount, who positions himself in front of the door. On a count of three, Nyoma reaches out with the tendrils of her power and slams the door to the room with a resounding crack! Bounty commands, \"IN THE NAME OF THE FLAMING FIST PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPONS!\" And at the same time, Friendly collects nature's power within herself and unleashes it as a thunderous wave of pressure right into the small room. The four redcloaks are indeed there, and one is knocked off his feet into the wall behind them. The remaining thugs seem terrified at the power being unleashed on them, but Jaran screams \"Fight them, boys! It's this or death!\" And the gang members lunge forward at the characters. A short bloody fight ensues, in which Nyoma tries again to command the youths to lay down their weapons, but they are too caught up in the rush of battle. By the end, Jaran is unconscious and Bount is once again bleeding through his coat, but the Redbrands have been put down with no actual deaths.</p>\n        <p>The party wakes one of the other three non-Jaran redcloaks, and interrogates him. Friendly intimidates him with a murderous-seeming fakeout involving death threats and a coin, but eventually the Redbrand member fesses up that this room is but the entrance to a larger secret complex underneath the manor which the Redbrands use as a hideout. He informs the characters the Redbrands are just local boys hired by a wizard named Glasstaff. The youth counts their number at around a dozen, not including the hobgoblins. \"Hobgoblins?\" Inquires almost everyone in the party simultaneously, to which the redcloak responds, \"Oh, yeah. The spider sent them to make sure we was doing what he wants, since I guess Glasstaff works for him.\" The characters share a look of surprise and intrigue at this, though Chappy seems inordinately happy about \"conspiracies\" and \"dark secrets.\" \"Think of the story this could be!\" she tells the group. The characters inquire about what this particular gang member has been up to, and he insists he has been mostly harmless, just exorting businesses for protection money. He does let slip that Jaren did kill that one wood worker, and they did end up kidnapping the woodworker's wife and daughter to be held here in the complex, but he insists that was Jaren and that everyone knows Jaren has a temper. After some haranging about morality and good decisions and making better choices by Nyoma, the group opts to let the three follower gang members leave after forcing them to promise to atone for their crimes by working for Sister Graele at the shrine. And also by leaving their coinage and valuables here to be collected by the party. The four unanimously agree to however leave Jaren tied up in the side room where the melee occurred. The follower ex-Redbrands beat it out of the cellar, but not before providing two more helpful bits of information: one, to watch out for the \"eye monster,\" and two, that the prisoners are near the old crypt, which is full of \"horrible old walking skeletons, like something out of a nightmare.\"</p>\n        <p>Exploring the wall to the left of the cistern, the party is able to discover a secret door leading to a long hallway passing off into unknown regions. Friendly transforms into a rat, and begins stalking forward down the twisting hall. The hall eventually opens up into a long, tall natural cavern with a chasm running longwise through it. As Friendly the rat studies the scene before her, an intrusive thought in her head suddenly adopts words as a rasping sentence is forced into her consciousness: \"Well, hello there interesting little creature. You are much too big for the tiny body you currently inhabit.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  } else {\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default SessionDescriptions;","import React from 'react';\nimport SessionDescriptions from './SessionDescriptions.js';\nimport Col from 'react-bootstrap/Col';\nimport Container from 'react-bootstrap/Container';\nimport Image from 'react-bootstrap/Image';\nimport Media from 'react-bootstrap/Media';\nimport Row from 'react-bootstrap/Row';\nimport ScrollableAnchor from 'react-scrollable-anchor'\nimport { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome';\nimport { faTimes } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons';\nimport data from './data.json';\nimport './App.css';\n\nfunction CharacterPortrait(props) {\n  return (\n    <Col key={props.name} className=\"character-portrait-container\" sm={4} xs={6}>\n      <a href=\"#card\" onClick={props.onClick}>\n        <Image src={props.img} className=\"character-portrait img-shadow\" alt={props.name} />\n      </a>\n      <a href=\"#card\" onClick={props.onClick} className=\"character-portrait-name text-info\">{props.name}</a>\n    </Col>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction shuffleArray(array) {\n  const array2 = array.slice();\n  let i = array2.length - 1;\n  for (;
